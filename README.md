## DerpiesD's Nvim config

This repository contains my personal nvim configuration for easier sharing between workspaces.

Currently, it uses:
- VimPlug - Vim plugin manager
    - This needs to be installed separately. Detail can be found (here)[https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug]
- CoC - autocomplete provider and language server protocol processor.
- Netwr - default built in file explorer

At the same times, it provides support for:
- Zig - lsp and highlighting

There's many thing I planned to add here in the future, including:
- Python
- Rust
- Lua
